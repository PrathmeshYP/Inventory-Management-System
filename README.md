##🧾 How Stock Management Works

- Products are stored in the products table
- Each product has a quantity column
- Stock IN → increases quantity
- Stock OUT → decreases quantity (no negative stock allowed)
- Available stock is displayed using a Treeview table
- All updates are saved permanently in SQLite
